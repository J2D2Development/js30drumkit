<h2>My take on the drumkit from Wes Bos js30 Course</h2>
Want to give it a shot?  Clone the repo, npm install (to get Express for the simple node server that runs the app), open a command prompt and run "npm start".

<em>Note: for some reason, the sounds don't play in Firefox.  It doesn't recognize my js file- might be an issue with the way it's being served?  I haven't dug too deep yet, but it works in Chrome and Edge.</em>
